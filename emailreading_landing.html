					<h4>If you want to know more you can read the answers to our frequently asked questions below:</h4>
					<h2>About the Tarot</h2>
					<h3>What is the tarot?</h3>
					<p>The tarot is a deck of 78 cards. It has 4 suits (Wands, Cups, Swords and Coins which are also called Pentacles) 56 cards altogether and another group of 22 cards called the Major Arcana which has strange pictures on them with titles like The Magician, The High Priestess, The Lovers or The Moon. It was originally used for playing card games and later they started to be used for divination/cartomancy.</p>
					<h3>What is the origin of the tarot cards?</h3>
					<p>The first tarot decks we know of were created in the 15th century in Italy and quickly spread all over europe. They were used to play card games.</p>
					<h3>When did they start using them for divination / fortune telling?</h3>
					<p>Only in the 18th century. The deck they started to use for divination was called the Tarot of Marseilles. Later A. E. Waite designed and published the deck which is now known as the Rider-Waite-Smith deck. This was created for divination and is the most popular tarot deck today. Later from the late 80s and 90s a lot of new tarot cecks were created mainly for divination. Many of these are beautiful art objects.</p>
					<h2>About Tarot Readings</h2>
					<h3>What does a tarot reading look like?</h3>
					<p>The client asks a question. The reader shuffles the cards and picks a number of cards and arranges them in a certain pattern. This is called a card spread. Then they interpret the cards. The cards have their own meaning and the place they occupy in the card spread also has a meaning. The two together gives insights into different aspects of the client's question. Looking at all the cards the reader can look at the client's question from several directions and can give advice and help the client find solutions to their problem.</p>
					<h3>How do the tarot cards work during a reading?</h3>
					<p>Many people talk about mystical energies at work which makes you pick the right cards during a reading. I think nobody really knows why the cards work but they do. I personally believe in a kind of meaningful coincidence. When you ask a question and randomly pick a card to find an answer, this random card will tell you something about your question and will guide you to find your answer.</p>
					<h2>Tarot Coaching</h2>
					<h3>What is the difference between fortune telling and tarot coaching?</h3>
					<p>A fortune teller tries to tell you what the future holds for you. They also usually use a lot of esoteric, mystical sounding words which might not make too much sense to most of us. During a tarot coaching session we look at a question or a situation and see what are the roots of this situation and what steps the client needs to take to get the most desirable outcome or the one they would like to achieve. I use plain, everyday language. No esoteric mumbojumbo. Trying to help you get more clarity in your situation and find your way forward.</p>
					<h3>How does your email tarot reading service work?</h3>
					<p>After you clicked the "Get your Email Tarot Reading" button you will be taken to a page where you will need to fill out an online form with your contact details and your question. You can give me some background information as well which can help me to get a more accurate answer for you. You will need to tick a couple of checkboxes to prove that you are 18 years of age or older and have read the disclaimer information which I highly recommend to do and you can check out in the <a href="disclaimer.html" target="_blank">Important Information</a> section. Below this you will be able to fill in your payment details and pay with a bank card or PayPal. You will get a confirmation email.</p>
					<p>I will pick the cards and interpret them and after 3-5 working days you will get another email with your detailed tarot reading in PDF format. This will include a photo of the card spread I used and a detailed Interpretation with suggestions on how to get the best outcome in your situation.</p>
					<p>It is possible that I will have same questions when I am making your reading. In this case I will contact you by email. After receiving your reading you will also have the opportunity to ask me questions about your reading in an email.</p>
<!--					<p>But before you do this you should subscribe to my newsletter as you will get a 25% off coupon for doing so.</p>-->
					<h3>Shouldn't I pick the cards myself? Will it work if you pick them instead?</h3>
					<p>Many tarot readers ask the client to shuffle or pick the cards. Many of them even think that this is necessary for the cards to work. But this is only a myth. I almost never let other people handle my cards and still get accurate results. Since the start of the pandemic many tarot readers started to do online sessions and they realised that they get the exact same accurate results if they pick the cards themselves. <strong>My experience shows that it does not matter exactly how you pick the cards, you will get the cards that you need to get.</strong></p>
					<h3>If you see something bad will you tell me?</h3>
					<p>I am not that type of tarot reader who will only tell you about your nice and shiny future. Most people who go to a tarot reader have a problem they are struggling to solve. The solution will possibly include hard work. But I will always try to tell you the hard things in the nicest possible way and I will always give you hints as to how can you find your way out of your situation and can make your life better. I will always try to give you an emotional boost and make you feel better about your situation.</p>
					<h2>Help with Questions</h2>
					<h3>Can I ask anything?</h3>
					<p>In theory yes but I will not read ethically problematic questions. Like "does my colleague cheat on his wife?"" It is their life, none of our business.</p>
					<h3>Can I have a general reading?</h3>
					<p>You can ask me to do a general reading like "what will come up in my life in the next 6 months?" Though you need to know that usually the more general the question the more general the answer as well. You can get the best results if you ask specific questions.</p>
					<h3>Can you give me some examples what are good questions to ask?</h3>
					<p>As I said it is better to ask specific questions. You can ask things like "will I find love in the next year?" or "Is it a good time to start a new business, will it be successful?" but the best questions are not just asking about a situation's outcome but try to ask things like "Why are my relationships all unsuccessful and what can I do to have a lasting relationship?" or "What steps should I take to make my business more successful?". But usually whatever your question I will always try to look at the root of your problem and the steps you need to take to get the best possible outcome. So you do not have to worry too much about your question. I will try to get the most out of it when I do your reading.</p>
